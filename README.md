LeanKitKanban Client for Java
=============================

This is a java java implementation to simplify integration with the
[LeanKitKanban restful
api](http://support.leankitkanban.com/forums/20153741-api).

It is currently limited to the creation of tickets and comes with a stateful
and simplified client.
